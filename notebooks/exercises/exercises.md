# Exercises for Data Fest Python tutorial 2017

Note: there is a set of example solutions sitting in this directory. It will be best to try the exercises on your own first and refer to these examples if you become stuck. For each exercise start from a scratch empty notebook so that all of the potential issues with solving a data science problem are apparent. What packages should you import? What cell magics should be used? How are the various pieces of functionanlity you have learned accessed?

### 1. First Look
Employ the techniques taught in the "Taking a first look at your data" portion of the course to review the data in file relative_valuation.csv.

### 2. Univariate Stats
Using the things we have learned in the "Univariate statistics" portion of our class, review the data in relative_valuation.csv. Before you begin come up with some hypotheses about the data before you begin, and check them as you proceed.

### 3. Regression
Produce a regression model using relative_valuation.csv. The target variable is p/e (price to earning ratio) and the remainder of the data can be used as covariates. The code in baseball_regression_lasso.ipynb will be useful.
